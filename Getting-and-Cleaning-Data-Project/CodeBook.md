#CodeBook

This is a code book that describes the variables, the data for the clean and tidy data set generated by merging the test and train data set and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The new tidy data has dimention of [180 x 88] of which the first column is the `Subject_ID`, secound column is `Activity_Name` and third column onward till the 88 columns are the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (Columns are only the measurements on 'mean' or 'std' which is 86 variable). 

The first column is `Subject_ID` are subject id who performed the activity, Its range is from 1 to 30.

The secound column is the `Activity_Name`. The activities are like (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

The third column onwards till 88 th column are the average of each variable for each activity and each subjects (of the extracted variables only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement, in all these are 86 variables).

Details of the original and the final Header names is shown at Appendix A:


## The data source

* Data using for this assignment : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Original Source and description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


## Transformation details

There are 5 parts:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


## Merge_data
### Data of merge_data
Following text files are used for meaging data.

 - `train/subject_train.txt` is read into the local variable, `subject_train` containing all the possible subject data inside the training set.
 - `train/X_train.txt` is read into the local variable, `x_train` containing all the 541 columns of raw data in the training set
 - `train/y_train.txt` is read into the local variable, `y_train` containing all the possible label data inside the training set.

 - `test/subject_test.txt` is read into the local variable, `subject_test` containing all the possible subject data inside the test set.
 - `test/X_test.txt` is read into the local variable, `x_test` containing all the 541 columns of raw data in the test set
 - `test/y_test.txt` is read into the local variable, `y_test` containing all the possible label data inside the test set. 
 
 - `activities.txt` is read into the local variable, `activity_labels` containing all the different types of activities: `WALKING`,                 `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`, `SITTING`, etc
 - `features.txt` is read into the local variable, `features` containing all the different types of features:
 
### Combining into merge_data

 - `train_MergeData` is the merged data table of train data set with {'Suject_ID', 'Activity_Name' and 'Data of selected features'}
 - `test_MergeData` is the merged data table of test data set with {'Suject_ID', 'Activity_Name' and 'Data of selected features'}
 - `mergedAllData` is mearge data set of Training and Test data into single variable `MergedAllData`
 

## Tidy Data

Using the `reshape2` package the data is created into a tidy dataset.

- `melted_Data` is variable which contain the melt data using `Subject_ID` and `Activity_Name`.
- `tidy_Data` is the variable with tidy data obtained using the `dcast` function in reshape2 package which calulate the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the average of all the columns per `Subject_ID` and per `Activity_Name`. This tidy dataset will be written to file called `tidy_Data.txt`, which can also be found in this repository.
 

### Appendix A:

The final `tidy_Data` is set with the following columns. All units are maintained from the original data set. 
A file named `tidy_data.txt` is written from run_analysis.R.
